# 🐍 The Snake Game 

Obviously name sounds familiar.

Classic Snake Game is the one which has snake in there with only head and moves
with commands. It's tail increases as it eats the randomly placed fruits.

This is a console version just run the executable (**.exe**) created by IDE or
compile the code and then run **.exe** file.

I Wanted dive into some projects, after learning some basic c++. Then one of 
My classmate asked me to make a snake game with a tutorial on youtube.
And here are the results in front of you.

Problems i wanna solve
-   self kill
-   wall distortion
-   spawning of fruit behind tail
## 🎮 How to Play

If it's a console game so you only need to run the executable file. 
use the W, A, S and D keys to play
press G key to quit.

To change the speed change the sleep value in the Main function.

To remove the dimentional wall and put normal wall.
- comment out lines form 162 to 169.
- remove comment from lines 172 to 177.

One thing that is that the fruit can spawn on the any 
tail portion of the snake.
